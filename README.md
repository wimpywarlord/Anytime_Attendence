This is a service-based project, which helps us conduct the headcount in any kind of get together, club, chapter, group, association, body, crowd, company or participation. 
This has a wide range of application and can be actively used actively in the club and chapter meeting in our college itself. We can always see people passing a paper or phone around to manually type name and registration number during every single meeting and association. This is tiresome and dull, here knows our “Party Participation Tracker” which will make this a smooth and fun experience.
Right now the project is limited to a VinnovateIT lab in VIT-Vellore for testing the hypothesis of the need of the product and market alignment of the idea.
In the later versions, one can expect the app to be generalised for all sorts of getting together.
